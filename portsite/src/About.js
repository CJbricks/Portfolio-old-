            <p>
                I am a Web Devloper and Designer based in Denver CO.
                Begining in 2014 I studied Fine Art and Sculpture at RMCAD where I
                found inspiration in the work of many artists contributing to the contemporary
                art space based around technology <e>Post-Internet Conceptual Installation ie: Artie Vierkant, Timur Si Qin, Stillhouse Group</e>
                This led me to begin working with front end and designing my own spaces online.
                I am proficient in Javascript, Typescript, React, React Hooks, HTML/CSS.
